<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Natural language interfaces (NLIs) have been the "holy grail" of human-computer interaction and information search for decades. However, early attempts in building NLIs to databases did not achieve the expected success due to limitations in language understanding capability, extensibility and explainability, among others. The last 5 years have seen a major resurgence of NLIs in the form of virtual assistants, dialogue systems, and semantic parsing and question answering systems. The horizon of NLIs has also been significantly expanding beyond databases to, e.g., knowledge bases, robots, Internet of Things (virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa), Web service APIs, and more.
<br/>
<br/>
This has been driven by a number of profound revolutions: (1) In the big data era, and as digitalization continues to grow, there is a rapidly growing demand for interfaces that connect users to the ever-expanding data sources, services and devices in the computing world. NLIs represent a very promising technology to accomplish that as they provide users with a unified way to interact with the entire computing world using language, their natural way of communication, and (2) the renaissance and development of deep learning have brought us from rule and feature engineering to a world of neural architecture and data engineering, promising better language understanding, adaptability and scalability. As a result, many commercial systems like IBM Watson, Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Microsoft Cortana, as well as academic studies on NLIs to a wide range of backends have emerged in recent years.
<br/>
<br/> 
We think it is time to bring the related communities (e.g., NLP and machine learning, data management and databases, programming language, human-machine interaction) together to review the recent advances and revisit the challenges that led to the failure of earlier NLI systems, and discuss what the remaining challenges are and what to expect in the short- and long-term future.<br/><br></p>

      <p> My goal is to develop trustworthy systems that can communicate effectively with people and improve over time through interaction. I broadly identify with the machine learning (ICML, NeurIPS) and natural language processing (ACL, NAACL, EMNLP) communities.<br/><br/>

      Computers can do a lot, but tapping into their full power requires the rather non-trivial ability to program. I'm interested in building systems that learn to translate natural language descriptions (e.g., in English or Chinese) into programs (e.g., in Python or C++). Such systems would unlock the full power of computing to a much wider audience. A while back, I wrote a friendly introduction to natural language interfaces (XRDS magazine 2014) and a slightly more technical survey article on executable semantic parsing (CACM 2016). One idea we've explored is to "naturalize" a programming language gradually into a natural language (ACL 2017). One can also use natural language to describe classifiers directly rather than requiring labeled data (ACL 2018). The tension between the fuzziness of machine learning and the crispness of logic also fascinates me. On this note, we showed that neural networks can solve SAT problems with surprising accuracy despite not being told explicitly what a SAT problem is (ICLR 2019).<br/><br/>

      Despite the successes of machine learning, otherwise high-performing models are still difficult to debug and fail catastrophically in the presence of changing data distributions and adversaries. For example, on the SQuAD reading comprehension dataset we created (EMNLP 2016), we showed that state-of-the-art systems, despite reaching human-level benchmark performance, are easily fooled by distracting sentences in a way that no human would be (EMNLP 2017). Given society's increasing reliance on machine learning, it is critical to build tools to make machine learning more reliable in the wild. We've worked on using influence functions to understand black-box models (ICML 2017), semidefinite programming to provide certificates a neural network is safe from a class of adversaries (NeurIPS 2018), and distributionally robust optimization to ensure the fairness of machine learning models over time (ICML 2018).<br/><br/>

      Finally, I am a strong proponent of efficient and reproducible research. We have been developing CodaLab Worksheets, a platform that allows researchers to run and manage their experiments by maintaining the full provenance of an experiment from raw data to final results. Most of our recent papers have been published on CodaLab as executable papers. We are actively looking for contributors, so please contact me if you're interested! <br/><br/>

<p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers from different disciplines related to NLIs. As such, the workshop welcomes and covers a wide range of topics around NLIs, including (non-exclusively):
 
<ul>
<li>  
<b>Linguistic analysis and modeling.</b> What are the linguistic characteristics of human-machine interaction via NLIs? How to develop better models to accommodate and leverage such characteristics?
</li>

<li>
<b>Interactivity, continuous learning, and personalization.</b> How to enable NLIs to interact with users to resolve the knowledge gaps between them for better accuracy and transparency? Can NLIs learn from interactions to reduce human intervention over time?  How can NLIs (learn to) be customized and adapt to user preferences? %Interaction design, faithful generation, learning from user feedback, online learning.
</li>

<li>
<b>Data collection and crowdsourcing.</b> Modern machine learning models are data-hungry while data collection for NLIs are particularly expensive because of the domain expertise needed for formal meaning representation and grounding. How to collect data for NLIs at scale with low cost?
</li>

<li>
<b>Scalability, adaptability, and portability.</b> How to construct NLIs that can reliably and efficiently operate at a large scale (e.g., on billion-scale knowledge graphs)? How to construct NLIs that can simultaneously support multiple inter-connected domains of possibly different nature? How to transfer knowledge learned from existing domains to help learning in new domains?
</li>

<li>
<b>Explainability and trustworthiness.</b> How to make the reasoning process and the results explainable and trustworthy to users? How to help users understand how an answer is obtained or a command is executed?
</li> 

<li>
<b>Privacy.</b> How to ensure NLIs are compliant with privacy constraints? How to train, monitor, and debug NLIs within the compliance boundary?
</li>

<li>
<b>Evaluation and user study.</b> How to systematically evaluate different usability aspects of an NLI as perceived by users? What are the protocols for conducting a reproducible user study? Whether there is significant gap between in vitro and in vivo evaluation and how to bridge that?</li></ul></p>
