## Submission Guidelines

All papers will be peer reviewed, **single-blinded**. Submissions must be self-contained and in English. Papers must be submitted in PDF according to the new ACM format published in [ACM guidelines](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template), selecting the generic "sigconf" sample. **The accepted papers will be published on the workshop's website and will not be considered archival for resubmission purposes.**

We are soliciting submissions in three categories of papers: 

*   Full workshop papers of original research (8 pages + 1 page for references) 
*   Short workshop papers of original research (2-4 pages + 1 page for references)
*   Position/visionary papers (unlimited)

### Full Workshop Paper

Authors should submit a long paper of up to 8 pages, with up to 1 additional page for references. The reported research should be original work. All papers will be presented as posters, and a few selected papers may also be presented orally at the discretion of the program committee. 


### Best Paper Award

From the submitted full workshop papers, between zero and two papers will be selected for best paper awards at the discretion of the program committee.

### Short Workshop Paper

Preliminary ideas or results may also be submitted as short papers, with a length of 2 to 4 pages plus 1 additional page for references. Similarly to full papers, these abstracts will follow the new ACM format, be submitted through EasyChair, and be reviewed by the program committee. Accepted papers will be presented as posters. Submissions should put "**This is a submission for the short paper track.**" at the end of the abstract submitted to EasyChair (it does not need to be noted in the paper itself).


### Position/Visionary Paper

We also encourage position or visionary papers that propose new directions of relevant research, advocate innovative approaches to long-standing problems, or report on deep insights gained from experience with existing systems. There is no page limit for such submissions. Accepted papers will be presented as posters. Papers should put "**This is a submission for the position/visionary paper track.**" at the end of the abstract submitted to EasyChair (it does not need to be noted in the paper itself).
