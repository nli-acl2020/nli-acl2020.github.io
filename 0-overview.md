# Overview
The *1st Workshop on Knowledge Base Construction, Reasoning and Mining (KBCOM)* is a new workshop that will be co-located with [WSDM 2018](http://www.wsdm-conference.org/2018/). The success of data mining and search technologies is largely attributed to the efficient and effective analysis of structured data. Automated construction, mining and reasoning of [knowledge bases and graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base) have become possible as research advances in many related areas such as *information extraction*, *natural language processing*, *machine learning* and *databases*. KBCOM aims to gather together leading experts from industry and academia to share their visions about the field, discuss latest research results, and exchange exciting ideas. 

We aim to complement the main conference by trying to achieve the following goals:

+ *Research horizons in KBCOM*: The workshop focuses on **invited talks** from leading experts and **position papers**  discussing forward-looking work. Its program comprises a good number of [keynote speakers](http://kbcom.org/3-speaker.html) from both leading universities (Stanford, University of Washington and more) and industrial organizations like Amazon and Recruit Institute of Technology.

+ *Idea exchange in KBCOM*: We will organize a **poster session** for researchers to share ideas, collect feedback and form collaborations. We particularly encourage participants to publish **new software and datasets** on related topics, and will hold novel **shared tasks** to help develop a better community.

We expect the highlight of the workshop to be the discussions and brainstorming during invited talks and poster session. The workshop will also accept **regular submissions** of original research or position/visionary papers which will be presented either as *highlight talks* or during the poster session. With such focuses, KBCOM aims to provide a vivid forum of discussion about knowledge base-related research.
